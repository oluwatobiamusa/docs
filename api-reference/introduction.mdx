## Welcome

Our **Developer Documentation** is here to walk you through all the steps of integrating powerful financial services right into your application. From your initial system set up (like **authentication**, setting up **webhooks**, and understanding the **request structure**) to actually creating financial products (like **accounts**, **transfers**, and **cards**), you can expect a detailed guide on going live with the Cray Finance API.
