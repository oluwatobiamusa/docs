Our **Developer Documentation** is here to walk you through all the steps of integrating powerful financial services right into your application. From your initial system set up (like **authentication**, setting up **webhooks**, and understanding the **request structure**) to actually creating financial products (like **accounts**, **transfers**, and **cards**), you can expect a detailed guide on going live with the Cray Finance API.

We treat every business as a standalone organization, and that’s why you need to **sign up and create your Cray Finance account** (or sign in if you already have one). You’ll need to be signed into your **Cray Finance Dashboard** to manage and access critical resources like your organization’s **authentication keys**, users, applications, customers, transactions, accounts, and everything else you do with the API.
