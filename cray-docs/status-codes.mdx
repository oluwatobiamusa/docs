## CLR001 – Security Violation

This transaction was flagged and declined due to exceeding the allowed number of transactions within a specific time frame (velocity limit) for the card. This is a preventive measure against potential misuse or automated fraudulent activity.

## CLR002 – Security Violation

This transaction failed an internal fraud detection mechanism. It may have been identified as suspicious due to unusual patterns such as high-risk geolocation, blacklisted accounts, or anomalies in behavior based on historical data.

## CLR003 – Single Transaction Limit Exceeded

The transaction amount exceeded the maximum allowed limit for a single transaction, as defined by cardholder or account policy. To proceed, the transaction must be split or limits adjusted.

## Pending — Initiated Charge

The transaction has been initiated and is awaiting further processing. It may be awaiting auser action (e.g., OTP or 3D Secure authentication).

## Successful

The transaction was processed and authorized without any issues.

## Failed

The transaction could not be completed due to an error. This may be due to insufficient funds, declined authorization, or system-level interruptions.

## Abandoned

The user initiated the transaction but did not complete the required steps. This typically happens when users close the app/browser, get redirected without finalizing payment, or fail to respond to authentication prompts.

## NGN Payout errors

- **PMN-96-422** = System Malfunction
- **PMN-59-422** = Suspected Fraud
