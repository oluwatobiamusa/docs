## CLR001 – Security Violation

This transaction was flagged and declined due to exceeding the allowed number of transactions within a specific time frame (velocity limit) for the card. This is a preventive measure against potential misuse or automated fraudulent activity.

## CLR002 – Security Violation

This transaction failed an internal fraud detection mechanism. It may have been identified as suspicious due to unusual patterns such as high-risk geolocation, blacklisted accounts, or anomalies in behavior based on historical data.

## CLR003 – Single Transaction Limit Exceeded

The transaction amount exceeded the maximum allowed limit for a single transaction, as defined by cardholder or account policy. To proceed, the transaction must be split or limits adjusted.

## CLR005 – Security Violation Mismatch

The transaction failed due to a security validation mismatch between the request details and the expected security parameters (such as authentication data, encryption, or integrity checks). To proceed, ensure that all security credentials, signatures, and request headers are correctly generated and aligned with the required security configuration.

## CLR006 — CardType not allowed

The transaction was declined because the specified card type is not permitted for this operation, merchant, or account configuration. To proceed, use an allowed card type or update the merchant or account settings to support this card type.

## Pending — Initiated Charge

The transaction has been initiated and is awaiting further processing. It may be awaiting auser action (e.g., OTP or 3D Secure authentication).

## Successful

The transaction was processed and authorized without any issues.

## Failed

The transaction could not be completed due to an error. This may be due to insufficient funds, declined authorization, or system-level interruptions.

## Abandoned

The user initiated the transaction but did not complete the required steps. This typically happens when users close the app/browser, get redirected without finalizing payment, or fail to respond to authentication prompts.

Understanding these statuses helps in monitoring transaction outcomes and implementing appropriate business logic.
