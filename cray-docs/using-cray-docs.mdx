Here’s how we think you’d make the best use of these Docs:

1. Do not skip the overview pages of any section. It contains all the required fundamentals that you need to know about a product
2. When using the API reference, enter your Secret Key in the authentication header of any endpoint you want to try out, and you’re good to go.
3. We suggest that you test our API endpoints with your own Postman application, as the API reference may not always contain all of the endpoints that we have.
4. If you do not understand any part of the Docs, please contact Support and ask any questions you may have.
