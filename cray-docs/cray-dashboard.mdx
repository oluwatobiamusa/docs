The Cray Finance Dashboard gives you all the tools and insights you need to integrate, monitor, and manage everything happening on your application through the Cray Finance API.

As you’ll see throughout this documentation, the Dashboard provides powerful back-office functionality across all our products — including creating accounts, viewing transaction details, freezing or unfreezing accounts, and more. Everything available on the Dashboard can also be performed directly via the API.

Below are a few important things to note:

### Balances

Your Cray finance dashboard is the central place for tracking all inflows and outflows across your organisation. You'll find your balances clearly displayed here.

Cray Finance provides two types of balances on the Dashboard:

- Main Balance
- Settlement Balance

  <Note>
    _Currently, Cray Finance supports _**_multiple currencies_**_, including _**_NGN, USD, and KES_**_, for both balances_
  </Note>

### Main Balance

Your **Main Balance** is the primary wallet on the Cray Finance Dashboard. It works just like a business account for your organisation within Cray Finance. All fees, commissions, transfers, and similar transactions are debited from this balance.

<Info>
  _Withdrawals from the Main Balance can only be done using the Transfers feature on the Dashboard._
</Info>

### Settlement Balance

The **Settlement Balance** is a temporary holding balance. This is where all payments received through Checkout and Collection Accounts are settled.

When you receive funds through these channels, the money is added to your Settlement Balance. **The next working day**, Cray Finance collates the total amount received and pays it out either to your designated settlement bank account or your Main Balance.

<Info>
  **Can I withdraw from my Settlement Balance?**

  _No. The Settlement Balance cannot be withdrawn from directly because it is a temporary balance.\
  To access the funds, you must wait until the next working day for the payout into either your bank account or your Main Balance._
</Info>

### KYB Verification

Every organisation onboarded to Cray Finance is required to complete KYB verification. This process ensures compliance with regulatory standards and helps us maintain a secure and trusted financial ecosystem.

During KYB verification, you will not be able to go live. However, you can still explore and test the Cray Finance API in **Test Mode**.
