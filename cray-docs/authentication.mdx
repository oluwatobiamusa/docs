Learn how to authenticate your connection to the Cray Finance API.

To interact with the Cray Finance API, you must first authenticate your requests. We use API keys to identify and authorize every call you make. Without a valid API key, your requests will fail.

🚧 **Important:**

Requests with a missing, invalid, or incorrect API key will fail with a `401 Unauthorised` error.

## Finding Your API Keys

To find your API keys, sign in to your Cray Finance Dashboard. Go to **Settings → Developer**. You will see two types of keys: a **Public Key** and a **Secret Key**.

## Understanding Your API Keys

### 1. Public Key (`pk_...`)

Your Public Key is your organization’s identifier. It is safe to use in your client-side code (like your website or mobile app).

Its primary use is to initialize our client-side widgets and identify your account when creating tokens. Public keys cannot modify your account or access sensitive data.

### 2. Secret Key (`sk_...`)

Your Secret Key is highly confidential and must never be shared publicly (e.g., in front-end code, public repositories, or insecure messages).

This key is used for all server-side API calls and grants full access to your account, including accessing data, moving funds, and modifying settings. Treat your Secret Key like a password.

Always store your secret keys securely and consider rotating them periodically.

📘 **Tip**

You can revoke and generate new API keys at any time from the Developer settings page. If you suspect a key has been compromised, generate a new one immediately and update your integration.

## Authenticating Your API Call

To authenticate a server-side request, include your Secret Key in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme.

```
Authorization: Bearer sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

📘 **Note**

When adding this to your code, replace `sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` with your actual Secret Key. Remember to use your **Test Key** for development and your **Live Key** for production.

## Troubleshooting 401 Errors

If you are consistently receiving `401 Unauthorised` error responses, check for these common issues:

- **Using an old or revoked key:** When you generate a new API key, any previous key is automatically revoked. Ensure all your services are updated with the new key.
- **Using the wrong key type:** You cannot use a Public Key (`pk_...`) for server-side authentication. Server-side requests always require a Secret Key (`sk_...`).
- **Typo in the key:** API keys are long, complex strings. It’s best to copy and paste your key directly from the dashboard. Do not type it manually.
- **Wrong environment:** Your Test Mode keys are different from your Live Mode keys. They are not interchangeable. Confirm you are using the correct key for the environment you are targeting.
