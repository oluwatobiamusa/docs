Cray offers two distinct API environments: Sandbox (Test) and Live (Production). Understanding how each works ensures smooth integration and deployment.

### Sandbox Environment

This environment is built for testing. It mimics real-world scenarios with simulated data — so you can build, test, and debug safely without affecting actual accounts or funds.

The **Sandbox** environment provides a secure and isolated space to test Ramp’s APIs. It replicates the live environment, allowing you to experiment without affecting real-world transactions.

In the sandbox, you can simulate different card payment scenarios to ensure your integration handles them correctly.

  _These features are vital for validating your integration before moving to live operations._

### Live Environment

This is the production environment where real customers, data, and transactions are handled. Only move here after successful testing in the sandbox.

<Info>
  **Key things to note**

  - **Separation**: Sandbox and Live environments are fully isolated — with different API keys, business IDs, and credentials
  - **Real vs Simulated Data:** Sandbox transactions are simulated. Live transactions involve actual money and customer data.
