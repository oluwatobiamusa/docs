description: "Our Developer Documentation is here to walk you through all the steps of integrating powerful financial services right into your application. From your initial system set up (like authentication, setting up webhooks, and understanding the request structure) to actually creating financial products (like accounts, transfers, and cards), you can expect a detailed guide on going live with the Cray Finance API."

We treat every business as a standalone organization, and that’s why you need to sign up and create your Cray Finance account (or sign in if you already have one). You’ll need to be signed into your Cray Finance Dashboard to manage and access critical resources like your organization’s authentication keys, users, applications, customers, transactions, accounts, and everything else you do with the API.

Cray Finance supports payment processing and collections in multiple African currencies, enabling cross-market operations and regional scalability. Currently, Cray processes payments in the following currencies:

- Kenyan Shilling (KES)
- Nigerian Naira (NGN)
- Ghanaian Cedi (GHS)
- Zambian Kwacha (ZMW)
- West African CFA Franc (XOF)

This multi-currency support allows businesses to build localized financial experiences while operating through a single, unified API.
