## Verify Transaction

The GET Requery endpoint is your instant way to check on any money you’ve sent out! It allows you to immediately retrieve the current status of a specific payout using its unique `transaction_id` as a path parameter (`/api/payout/requery/{transaction_id}`). This is super useful for confirming whether a disbursement was successful, pending, or failed, which ensures transparency and makes troubleshooting or reconciliation processes a total breeze!
