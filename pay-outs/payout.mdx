title: "Payouts"
---

This guide provides a developer-focused walkthrough of the Cray Finance Payouts API. Integrating our payout functionality involves a series of API calls designed to ensure accuracy, security, and a smooth user experience. Following this workflow will help you build a robust payout system.

## Supported Payout Currencies

Our platform supports payouts in the following currencies:

- **USD**: United States Dollar
- **ZMW**: Zambian Kwacha
- **GHS**: Ghanaian Cedi
- **XOF**: West African CFA franc
- **NGN**: Nigerian Naira

## Payout Process Overview

The payout workflow is designed to be sequential and idempotent. Each step provides necessary information for the next, culminating in the final disbursement. The core process is as follows:

1.  **Fetch Available Payment Methods**: Dynamically determine which payout channels are available for a given country.
2.  **Fetch Supported Banks**: Retrieve an up-to-date list of supported banks for bank transfer operations.
3.  **Validate Beneficiary Account**: Perform a pre-transaction check to verify account details and receive a reference ID.
4.  **Initiate Disbursement**: Execute the payout transaction using the reference ID to send funds to the recipient.
5.  **Requery Transaction Status**: Asynchronously check the final status of the payout.

### 1. Fetch Available Payment Methods

**Endpoint**: `GET /payout/payment-methods/{countryCode}`

Before initiating a payout, your application needs to know which payment channels (e.g., bank transfer, mobile money) are supported in the target country. By calling this endpoint with a country code, you receive a list of valid payment methods.

#### URL Parameters

- `countryCode` (string, required): The two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (e.g., `NG` for Nigeria).

---

### 2. Fetch Supported Banks

**Endpoint**: `GET /payout/banks`

For bank transfer payouts, it's crucial to provide users with an accurate list of supported institutions. This endpoint returns a comprehensive list of all banks integrated with our system. It requires no parameters.

---

### 3. Validate Beneficiary Account

**Endpoint**: `POST /payout/accounts/validate`

To prevent failed transactions, validate the beneficiary's account details before attempting a disbursement. By submitting the user's account number and bank code, the API returns the registered account name and a unique reference ID (`ref_id`) for the validation session. **This ID is required to process the transaction in the next step.**

#### Request Body

- `account_number` (string, required): The beneficiary's bank account number.
- `bank_code` (string, required): The unique code for the beneficiary's bank, retrieved from the `GET /payout/banks` endpoint.

#### Example Payload

```json
{
  "account_number": "0112345678",
  "bank_code": "058"
}
```

The response will contain a `ref_id` in the data object, which you must pass to the disbursement endpoint.

### 4. Initiate Disbursement

**Endpoint**: `POST /payout/disburse`

Once the account is validated, you can initiate the payout. This endpoint processes the actual fund transfer to the recipient's account. The `ref_id` from the validation step must be included in the request to link the disbursement to a verified account.

#### Example Payload

- `customer_reference` (string, required): A unique identifier for the transaction from your system.
- `amount` (number, required): The amount to be disbursed.
- `narration` (string, required): A brief description of the transaction.
- `ref_id` (string, required): The reference ID obtained from the account validation step. This links the disbursement to a successful validation.

The exact structure of the payload will vary depending on the payout currency. The example below is for a disbursement in **NGN**. You can test the endpoint on the process transfer page listed on the sidebar menu to see other currencies' payload.

```json
{
  "customer_reference": "your_unique_reference",
  "account_number": "0123456789",
  "bank_code": "058",
  "amount": "10",
  "narration": "Testing",
  "recipient_name": "John Doe",
  "ref_id": "sess_692824141b221c00d70876e5",
  "sender_info": {
    "name": "Johnson",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "email": "johnson@example.com"
  }
}
```

### 5. Requery Transaction Status

**Endpoint**: `GET /payout/requery/{transaction_id}`

Payouts are often processed asynchronously. After initiating a disbursement, use this endpoint to determine its final status.

#### URL Parameters

- `transaction_id` (string, required): The unique transaction ID returned by the `POST /payout/disburse` endpoint.
