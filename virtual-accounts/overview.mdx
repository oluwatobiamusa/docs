Cray Finance Virtual Accounts provide a powerful tool for streamlining your collections and reconciliation process. By generating a dedicated virtual account number for each customer or transaction, you can enable them to receive payments directly via bank transfer.

This allows for:

- **Easy Customer Payments:** Customers simply transfer funds to a unique account number.
- **Automated Reconciliation:** Since each account is tied to a specific entity or reference, your system can instantly and accurately link the incoming payment to the correct customer or invoice, eliminating manual tracking.

We support the creation of both **Permanent** (tied to a customer for continuous use) and **Temporary** (for one-time or specific collections) virtual accounts.
